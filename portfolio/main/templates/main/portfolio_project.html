                <div class="card-custom-content p-4">
                    <p>First of all, I’ve used Docker and Docker Compose to host my different services, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Nginx revers proxy, which is also my web server</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The portfolio app, which is for my main page, and the project descriptions pages</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The four services for the Middle Earth Market app</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The four databases for each Middle Earth Service</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As I’ve read the Docker documentation, I found that the most secure way to pass each container
                        their
                        sensitive data, was Docker Secrets, so I used it. For this, I had to use Docker Swarm as an
                        orchestrator. In order for my applications to have access to the secrets (for example, Django
                        secret key, Signing/Validator key), I created a function that reads in the files, containing the
                        secret.</p>
                    <p>Nginx listens on port 80 and redirects calls to a https virtual server. This server then
                        forwards the client request to my gunicorn wsgi servers, depending on the url. The gunicorn
                        servers are responsible for communication between nginx and the Django web applications. Also,
                        nginx serves the static files for the applications.</p>
                    <p>I have hosted my website on a Linode shared server. After purchasing a server (Nanode 1 GB), I
                        have downloaded my docker images from Docker hub, and also the docker-compose.yaml and nginx
                        default.conf file from GitHub. I have also added the necessary secrets for the services to run.
                        After all these steps I was able to spin up my composition with Docker stack. As written in
                        Linode’s documentation to give security to my server, I have installed ufw (uncomplicated fire
                        wall), through which I allow communication only on certain ports, and deny the rest. Also, I
                        have created a sudo user which has reduced permissions, and disabled root user.</p>
                    <p>I have also purchased a custom domain with .hu top-level domain from Rackhost. Here all I had to
                        do is to create a domain on Linode with the same name, and connect my rackhost domain
                        nameservers to the ones provided on linode. This allowed me to manage my domain from linode. For
                        the sake of simplicity I gave an A record as “rothweilmiklos.hu” and a CNAME record as www so now
                        my website can be accessed both with and without www.</p>
                    <p>To have a ssl certificate, I have used Let’s encrypt free service which provided me a ssl
                        certificate and a private key.</p>
                    <p>A little extra: On the main portfolio page I have set up a contact section which communicates with the
                        server via ajax calls. I wrote a javascript file that sends the post request via ajax and also
                        writes out error messages above the contact form upon receiving one from the backend. The Django
                        app after receiving this request validates the form and if valid, sends an email via Amazon
                        Simple Email Service to my email address.</p>

                                    <p>I do realize that architecture is not the most efficient, especially in the market
                                        project, where the front-end and business logic is done in the same service. I
                                        want to further explore how a proper microservices structure is built and
                                        implement it there.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>I had fun with javascript (JQuery) while coding the AJAX post function and also
                                        creating visual elements (like the loading spinner when sending a contact
                                        email), so I would like to go deeper in understanding this language.</p>
